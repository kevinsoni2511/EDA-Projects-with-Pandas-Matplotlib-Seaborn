🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset
Welcome to a hands-on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project where we dive into the famous Titanic dataset to discover patterns, uncover hidden insights, and tell a story through data.

Using powerful Python tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into meaningful visual insights.
