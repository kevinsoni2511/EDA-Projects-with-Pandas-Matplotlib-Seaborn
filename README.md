# 🔍 ***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset***

Welcome to a hands-on ***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*** project where we dive into the famous ***Titanic dataset*** to discover patterns, uncover hidden insights, and tell a story through data.

Using powerful Python tools like ***Pandas***, ***Matplotlib***, and ***Seaborn***, this project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into meaningful visual insights.
